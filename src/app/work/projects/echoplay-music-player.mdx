## Overview

Echoplay is a full-featured music streaming app built on the MERN stack, featuring an admin panel for artists to manage albums and tracks, a user-friendly main app for streaming, playlist creation, Google authentication, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications.
## Key Features

- **Firebase Integration**: Integrated Firebase Cloud Messaging for realtime notification updates and Firebase Authentication for Authenticating users securely.
- **Albums Suggestions**: Developed a suggestions section based on user preferences and interests.
- **Queue Management**: The queue consists of two sections, first section displays the tracks of the playing album and the second section displays the tracks added by users. Users can switch between the both.
- **Library Section**: A section where users can create their own playlists and save tracks in them.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js and Express.js**: For creating a scalable backend for Restful APIs.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: For managing users' and artists' data on the cloud.
- **React**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Styled-Components**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

I was new to Cloud Platforms. Integrating Firebase was pretty challenging for me in the first place. It took me a lot of time in resolving errors related to the integration. Afterwards, I learned new things like advanced state management in React, Cloud Integrations etc.
